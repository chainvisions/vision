# Vision - Money as smart as it should be

## Introduction
Vision is a substrate-based blockchain with programmability in mind. The goal is for building on VISION to be seamless, offering the same toolset as Ethereum's, allowing for existing developers to seamlessly build on top of Vision as they would on Ethereum

### Initial Distribution
Vision IOUs will not be distributed through an ICO, seed round, etc. Instead, IOUs will be distributed in various methods. The first planned distribution of IOUs is through staking BELUGA tokens which will last for 2 weeks and will distribute a total of 1k IOUs. The other ways VISION will be distributed are to be determined and will be announced later on.
